                <h1>Brie cheese</h1>
                <p>Brie doesn’t make the US’s top 5 for sales, but is nonetheless very popular. Brie is soft and silky and comes in a round wheel with a light crust. It is generally eaten at room temperature with crackers or bread, and can almost be spread. It is great as a dessert by itself or in recipes like these Whipped Brie Stuffed Strawberries.</p>

                <h1>Cottage cheese</h1>
                <p>Cottage cheese is an American favorite made from cow’s milk. It is made by separating curds from the whey and is not pressed resulting in its lumpy creamy texture. It is extremely healthy with a 4 oz serving providing about 12 grams of protein and a variety of vitamins and minerals. It is, of course, great eaten right from the carton or with just about any fruit, but it is much more versatile than just that.</p>

                <h1>Cream cheese</h1>
                <p>So many of America’s favorite cheeses came from outside the borders. This makes sense as it is a young nation and cheese is an ancient food favorite. Cream cheese, however, was invented in Chester New York by Mr William Lawrence in 1872. He bought an existing cheese factory and commercialized the creamy spread we love today. Lawrence used a combination of milk and cream draining off the whey before pureeing the mixture to make the sweet spreadable cream cheese we put on bagels. The true superpower of cream cheese is its ability to be flavored to taste.</p>

                <h1>Emmental</h1>
                <p>This is a very old Swiss cheese from Bern Switzerland that dates back to the 13th Century. It is a lite yellow cheese with a mild yet savory taste. The curds are cooked before being pressed, and this process forms the bubbles that give emmental its distinct “Swiss cheese” holes.</p>

                <h1>Mozzarella</h1>
                <p>Mozzarella is a pasta filata, or stretched curd cheese, made by soaking the curd in water until it is sufficiently elastic that the cheese can be kneaded and stretched to give it the chewy elastic texture we recognize as mozzarella. Mozzarella was invented in Italy in 1570, but is of course today made worldwide and is the #3 most produced cheese in the United States making up 9% of all production.</p>
